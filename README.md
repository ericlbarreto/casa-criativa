The Casa Criativa Project is a website to add ideas to carry out at home, cooking, attending courses, etc. RocketSeat together with Potência Tech did this project and passed it on to us in the form of classes, I learned a lot in HTML, CSS, JS and Database.

## ✅ How to open the project?
Follow these steps to open the project on your computer (NODE NPM required):

- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ericlbarreto/casa-criativa.git
```
- Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
- Start server
```
npm run dev
```
- Open the website in your browser
```
localhost:3000
```

- ⚠️ My next step will be to learn how to deploy these projects with a back-end and database to facilitate access.

## 📚 New Learnings
- I further developed the back-end logic, receiving requests and sending responses, in addition to the general CSS and HTML logic.
- I used the nunjucks library which allows you to factor the HTML code, perform loops and variables, in addition to minimizing code repetition on different pages. In codes it is generally used by the {%%} tag
- For the first time, I used a database (SQLITE3) to store the ideas that the user registered on the website, storing data such as title, image link, description... of the registered idea.
